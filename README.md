# 3D-Image-Quality-Assessment-Benchmark
A list of state-of-the-art image quality assessment algorithms and databases collected by [Wei Zhou](http://home.ustc.edu.cn/~weichou). If you find that important resources are not included, please feel free to contact me.

3D/stereoscopic image quality assessment (SIQA) algorithms are typically divided into three categories as follows: 1) full-reference SIQA (FR SIQA), 2) reduced-reference SIQA (RR SIQA), and 3) no-reference SIQA (NR SIQA).
